# shaderjoy
Basically shaderjoy is shadertoy but to run natively instead of the webpage.

I started to do the raytracing series  https://raytracing.github.io/ on shadertoy but was limited because it's in the browser. I wanted to edit my shader with emacs reloading on each changes and commit my progression in a git repository. So I started shaderjoy, it follows the same variable names iFrame,... function name mainImage... the idea is when I am happy with a step I could publish to shadertoy.
